    <p>
      Hello! I'm Saad Hassan Saad, a 28-year-old Computer Science graduate with
      a passion for web development and education. I currently work as a Full
      Stack Web Development Instructor and serve as the Head of Software
      Department at the Academy of Digital Arts Egypt (ADA Egypt). With my
      background in computer science and hands-on industry experience, I'm
      dedicated to helping students master modern web development technologies
      and build successful careers in tech.

      My favorite color is black, which reflects my preference for clean,
      minimalist design in both code and user interfaces. I believe in writing
      elegant, maintainable code and creating learning experiences that empower
      the next generation of developers.
    </p>
